            <h2>The Genius of Albert Einstein</h2>
            <p class="date">March 29, 2025</p>
        </div>

        <div class="article-body">
            <p>Albert Einstein, one of the most brilliant minds of the 20th century, forever changed the way we understand the universe. His contributions to physics, especially the theory of relativity, paved the way for modern science and technology. He was not just a physicist but a visionary who saw the world differently. In this article, we dive into Einstein's life, achievements, and lasting legacy.</p>

            <h3>Early Life and Education</h3>
            <p>Albert Einstein was born in 1879 in Ulm, Germany. Despite showing early signs of brilliance, he was considered a late bloomer by his teachers. He went on to study mathematics and physics at the Polytechnic Institute in Zurich, Switzerland, where he earned his degree in 1900. It was during these early years that he developed his unique approach to problem-solving, which would later lead to groundbreaking discoveries.</p>

            <h3>The Theory of Relativity</h3>
            <p>Einstein's theory of relativity, particularly his famous equation <em>E = mc²</em>, changed the world’s understanding of space, time, and energy. This theory introduced the concept that time and space are not fixed and are instead relative to the observer. His work not only revolutionized physics but also had practical implications for technology, such as GPS systems, which rely on relativity to function correctly.</p>

            <h3>Einstein’s Later Life and Legacy</h3>
            <p>In his later years, Einstein continued to work on the unification of physical forces and was deeply involved in political and social issues. His advocacy for peace, civil rights, and disarmament made him a prominent figure not only in the world of science but also in global affairs. Today, his theories continue to influence many areas of science, from quantum mechanics to cosmology.</p>

            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>Albert Einstein's brilliance was not just in his discoveries but in his ability to question the status quo and challenge the limitations of existing knowledge. His theories reshaped science and have had lasting effects on how we view the universe and technology. His legacy remains an inspiration for future generations of thinkers and innovators.</p>

    <!-- Article 2: The Visionary Steve Jobs -->
    <div class="article-content">
        <div class="article-header">
            <h2>The Visionary Steve Jobs</h2>
            <p class="date">March 30, 2025</p>
        </div>

        <div class="article-body">
            <p>Steve Jobs was one of the most influential innovators of the 21st century. His work with Apple transformed technology, and his vision for the future of consumer electronics changed the world. From the iPhone to the iPad, Jobs’ innovations reshaped industries and revolutionized the way we interact with technology.</p>

            <h3>Early Life and Career</h3>
            <p>Born in 1955, Steve Jobs showed an early interest in electronics and technology. He dropped out of college but continued to attend classes that interested him, such as calligraphy. This would later influence the design aesthetics of Apple's products.</p>

            <h3>Apple's Founding and Revolutionizing the Tech Industry</h3>
            <p>In 1976, Jobs, along with Steve Wozniak, co-founded Apple. They introduced the Apple I, the first computer designed and sold by the company. Over the years, Apple introduced revolutionary products that made technology more accessible and user-friendly. The iPhone, iPod, and iPad were all groundbreaking devices that have changed the way people communicate, consume media, and connect with each other.</p>

            <h3>Jobs' Leadership and Legacy</h3>
            <p>Despite facing setbacks, including being ousted from Apple in 1985, Jobs’ return in 1997 marked the beginning of Apple’s dominance in the technology world. His leadership style, marked by his obsession with perfection and innovation, created one of the most valuable companies in the world. Steve Jobs passed away in 2011, but his influence on technology, business, and design lives on.</p>

            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>Steve Jobs' legacy is not just in the products he created, but in his vision and leadership. His passion for technology and his commitment to changing the world make him a prime example of how one mind can reshape industries and society.</p>

    <!-- Article 3: The Brilliant Inventor Nikola Tesla -->
    <div class="article-content">
        <div class="article-header">
            <h2>The Brilliant Inventor Nikola Tesla</h2>
            <p class="date">March 31, 2025</p>
        </div>

        <div class="article-body">
            <p>Nikola Tesla, a brilliant inventor and electrical engineer, was one of the most important figures in the development of modern electrical systems. He is credited with laying the foundations for alternating current (AC) power transmission, which powers the world today.</p>

            <h3>Early Life and Education</h3>
            <p>Born in 1856 in Smiljan, Croatia, Tesla showed an early interest in electricity. After studying engineering at the Technical University of Graz and the University of Prague, Tesla went on to work in several electrical companies before setting out to pursue his own groundbreaking inventions.</p>

            <h3>AC vs. DC: The War of Currents</h3>
            <p>One of Tesla’s most notable achievements was his development of alternating current (AC) electrical systems, which he argued were more efficient than Thomas Edison’s direct current (DC) systems. The resulting "War of Currents" saw Tesla's AC ultimately become the standard for electrical power transmission worldwide.</p>

            <h3>Tesla’s Inventions and Innovations</h3>
            <p>Tesla's inventions include the induction motor, the Tesla coil, and wireless communication technologies, which have had a lasting impact on modern technology. Many of his ideas, such as wireless power transmission and remote control, were considered ahead of their time and are only now being explored in modern research.</p>

            <h3>Legacy and Recognition</h3>
            <p>Despite struggling with financial difficulties and recognition during his lifetime, Tesla’s contributions to science and technology were largely overlooked. Today, he is widely regarded as one of the greatest inventors in history, with many honoring his work through statues, museums, and even the Tesla car company.</p>

            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>Nikola Tesla's work has had a profound and lasting impact on science, technology, and society. His forward-thinking ideas and inventions have shaped the world in ways that continue to benefit humanity today. Tesla's legacy serves as a testament to the power of curiosity, imagination, and invention.</p>
